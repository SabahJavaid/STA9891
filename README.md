STA 9891: Predicting The Risk of Defaulting Against Credit Risk Variables

By Sabah Javaid, Augustin Nare and Iftikar Ahmed

In this project, we are focused on predicting the default_ind (binary response variable where 1=defaulted loan and 0 otherwise) against other credit risk variables. We found the dataset on Kaggle.

The original number of features: p = 73 while sample size equated to n = 855,969.

After cleaning and organizing the data, we were left with p= 38 and n = 1000 where N(+)= 177 defaulted cases and N(-)= 745 non-defaulted cases.
